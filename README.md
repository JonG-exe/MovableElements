# MovableElements

The 'moveElements.js' script allows any element with the class name 'movable', the ability to be moved anywhere in the body by dragging it to a desired location. 'moveElements.js' is located in the js folder.

**Note:** If one intends to add elements dynamically to the document, they would have to call the makeMovable() function afterwards so that the event listeners and their respective functions (that make moving elements possible) can be added to those newly added elements.
